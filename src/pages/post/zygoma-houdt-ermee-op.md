De Gentse death/ math metal band **Zygoma** houdt er na tien jaar mee op. Hieronder vind je het volledige bericht dat de band de wereld instuurde:

>>>
To anyone who's ever been involved with this groups: thank you. This is the end. This year would've been the 10th anniversary of this band. There have been some weird things going on internally and we feel disconnected with what this band meant musically. We had a lot of fun along the way, played tons of shows and saw places we would've never ever seen otherwise. Thank you to everyone who made that possible. Me (Gert), Kenzo and Jonas are still having fun playing music together and are working on a new band. Keep an eye out for that.

If you'd wish to support us in our future endeavours, please go get something off our online store (cd and shirt are both €6): https://zygoma.bandcamp.com/

Thank you.
