De Antwerpse rock/ metal band Diablo Blvd houdt er definitief mee op! Een laatste optreden houdt de band 10 december in de AB in Brussel.

_Facebookbericht:_
  
To all of you reading this message we will start by announcing our first headline show ever at the legendary Ancienne Belgique on the 10th of December 2018. For some reason we never played the AB before so we’re absolutely thrilled to finally head over to one of Belgium’s most beautiful venues.

No doubt this will be a night to remember especially because it will also be our last show ever. Yes, you're reading this right: <span class="text_exposed_show">the DB is calling it a day.</span>

    We can imagine this might come as a surprise to many of you. Even for us it feels unreal knowing that we are about to close a very important chapter in our lives. In the last 13 years we’ve seen a lot of things come and go but we always did it our way. There’s no negativity here, there’s only love.

    Regarding all the booked summer shows: we cannot wait to continue our festival run and enjoy every last second of it. Looking forward to see you all out there.

    Sincerely,<br /> Alex, Andries, Kris, Tim & Jan
